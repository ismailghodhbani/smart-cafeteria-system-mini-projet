# Smart Cafeteria System – Mini Project

Our mini-project consists of designing a smart and secure digital cafeteria system based on IoT technologies. It uses an ESP32, a QR code scanning mechanism, and connected sensors, with Firebase as a cloud platform for authentication and data managem . 

## Project Overview
The system is built around an ESP32 microcontroller connected to sensors and actuators, with cloud integration using Firebase for authentication and data management.
It automates access control, reduces human errors, and improves security and efficiency.

## Technologies & Concepts
- IoT (ESP32, sensors, actuators)
- Networking fundamentals
- Cloud services (Firebase)
- Security and access control
- Web / mobile interaction concepts

## Academic Context
This project was developed as part of my academic training in **Réseaux, Systèmes et Télécommunications (RST)** at **ISET’COM**.

📄 The detailed project report is available in this repository.
